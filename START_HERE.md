## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### ⚠️ DO NOT SKIP FILE UPLOAD
Everything depends on it. Property submission (the core feature) requires video upload. Start here!

### ⚠️ TEST ON REAL DEVICES
- Camera and gallery don't work in emulators
- M-Pesa requires real phone for testing
- File upload needs real device testing

### ⚠️ FOLLOW THE ORDER
The specs have dependencies. Don't skip ahead or you'll have to redo work.

### ⚠️ TEST AS YOU GO
Don't wait until the end to test. Test each feature as you build it.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Copy the code examples** - We've provided 1000+ lines of working code
2. **Follow web patterns** - The web app has proven UI/UX patterns
3. **Test incrementally** - Test each feature before moving to the next
4. **Use real devices** - Emulators won't cut it for camera/M-Pesa
5. **Ask for help** - Reference the web implementation when stuck
