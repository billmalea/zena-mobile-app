## 🎯 Key Finding: Payment Polling

### Original Assumption (INCORRECT):
Mobile app needs to:
- Poll M-Pesa payment status every 3 seconds
- Implement payment polling service
- Handle timeout and retry logic
- Show real-time status updates

### Actual Implementation (CORRECT):
Backend handles everything internally:
- ✅ Initiates STK push
- ✅ Polls M-Pesa every 3s for 30s
- ✅ Sends WhatsApp notifications
- ✅ Returns final result to mobile

**Mobile just displays the result!**

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### 1. Always Verify Backend First
Don't assume mobile needs to implement everything. Backend might already handle complex logic.

### 2. Review Actual Code
Documentation can be outdated. Always check the actual implementation.

### 3. Look for Internal Processing
Check if backend tools have:
- Polling loops
- Multi-step workflows
- State management
- External API calls

### 4. Mobile Focuses on UI
Backend handles business logic, mobile displays results.

### 5. Test Assumptions Early
Verify requirements before starting implementation.

Only one spec needed updating (Spec 04), which has been completed. The mobile app implementation will be:

- ✅ **Simpler** than originally planned
- ✅ **More maintainable** with less code
- ✅ **Easier to test** with clear requirements
- ✅ **Faster to implement** with reduced complexity

**The implementation is ready to begin!** 🎉
