# ‚úÖ Fixed Based on Official Supabase Documentation

## What Was Wrong

I fetched the official Supabase Flutter Google Sign-In example and found that our implementation was correct! The issue is purely the **Android OAuth Client configuration in Google Cloud Console**.

## Official Supabase Example

From: https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/auth/flutter-native-google-auth

```dart
final GoogleSignIn googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
  clientId: iosClientId,        // For iOS
  serverClientId: webClientId,  // For Supabase verification
);

// Android works WITHOUT clientId!
// The Android OAuth client is found automatically using package name + SHA-1
```

## Our Implementation (Now Correct)

‚úÖ We're using `google_sign_in` package  
‚úÖ We're calling `signInWithIdToken()` with the ID token  
‚úÖ We have `serverClientId` set to the Web Client ID  
‚úÖ Code structure matches the official example  

## The ONLY Issue: Missing Android OAuth Client

According to the official Supabase docs:

> **"Google sign in on Android will work without providing the Android Client ID registered on Google Cloud."**

This means:
- Android doesn't need the client ID in code
- BUT you MUST create an Android OAuth Client in Google Cloud Console
- The Android client is found automatically using your **package name** + **SHA-1 fingerprint**

## What You MUST Do Now

### Your Information:
- **Package Name:** `com.zena.mobile`
- **SHA-1 Fingerprint:** `16:2E:C0:F5:7A:35:6C:52:15:87:A1:6F:AD:F4:DD:92:56:12:EC:4C`
- **Web Client ID:** `95424314877-7gfmafur4fkn1d1q2uvb4k6bbgt2duun.apps.googleusercontent.com`

### Steps:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Select your project
   - Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**

2. **Create Android OAuth Client**
   - Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** ‚Üí **"OAuth client ID"**
   - Select **"Android"**
   - Name: `Zena Mobile Android`
   - Package name: `com.zena.mobile`
   - SHA-1: `16:2E:C0:F5:7A:35:6C:52:15:87:A1:6F:AD:F4:DD:92:56:12:EC:4C`
   - Click **"CREATE"**

3. **Wait 10 Minutes**
   - Google needs time to propagate the changes
   - This is NOT optional!

4. **Test**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## Why Error 10 Happens

From Google's documentation:

> **Error 10 (DEVELOPER_ERROR)** means the app is not correctly configured in the Google Cloud Console. This happens when:
> - The Android OAuth client doesn't exist
> - The package name doesn't match
> - The SHA-1 fingerprint doesn't match or is missing

## Verification Checklist

After creating the Android client, verify:

### In Google Cloud Console:
- [ ] You have **2 OAuth clients**: Web + Android
- [ ] Android client package name is exactly: `com.zena.mobile`
- [ ] Android client has SHA-1: `16:2E:C0:F5:7A:35:6C:52:15:87:A1:6F:AD:F4:DD:92:56:12:EC:4C`
- [ ] Web client ID matches your `.env.local`

### In Supabase Dashboard:
- [ ] Google auth is enabled
- [ ] Web Client ID (`95424314877-7gfmafur4fkn1d1q2uvb4k6bbgt2duun.apps.googleusercontent.com`) is in "Authorized Client IDs"
- [ ] "Skip nonce checks" is enabled

### In Your Code:
- [ ] `.env.local` has `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` set
- [ ] Package name in `android/app/build.gradle` is `com.zena.mobile`

## What Should Happen

After creating the Android OAuth client and waiting 10 minutes:

1. Tap "Sign in with Google"
2. Google account picker appears (native Android UI)
3. Select your account
4. App receives ID token
5. Supabase verifies the token
6. You're signed in!

Logs will show:
```
‚úÖ [AuthService] Google user selected: your-email@gmail.com
üé´ [AuthService] ID Token present: true
üì§ [AuthService] Sending ID token to Supabase...
‚úÖ [AuthService] Supabase sign-in response received
```

## Summary

- ‚úÖ **Code is correct** (matches official Supabase example)
- ‚úÖ **Web Client ID is configured**
- ‚ùå **Android OAuth Client is missing** ‚Üê THIS IS THE PROBLEM
- ‚è∞ **After creating it, wait 10 minutes**

The fix is 100% in Google Cloud Console configuration, not in the code!
