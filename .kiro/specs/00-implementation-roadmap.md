# ZENA Mobile App - Complete Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the complete implementation plan to achieve feature parity between the Zena web and mobile apps. Based on comprehensive analysis of both codebases, we've identified **70% of web features missing** in mobile.

**Total Effort:** 4-6 weeks (with 2-3 developers)  
**Critical Features:** 4 specs (blocking core functionality)  
**High Priority:** 1 spec (needed for complete flows)  
**Medium Priority:** 2 specs (improves UX)  
**Low Priority:** 1 spec (polish)

## Analysis Documents Reference

Before starting implementation, review these analysis documents:

1. **ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary of gaps
2. **FEATURE_COMPARISON_TABLE.md** - Detailed feature comparison (75 features)
3. **ZENA_CHAT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md** - Complete technical analysis (2000+ lines)
4. **MOBILE_APP_IMPLEMENTATION_QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference guide
