# ZENA Mobile App - Complete Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the complete implementation plan to achieve feature parity between the Zena web and mobile apps. Based on comprehensive analysis of both codebases, we've identified **70% of web features missing** in mobile.

**Total Effort:** 4-6 weeks (with 2-3 developers)  
**Critical Features:** 4 specs (blocking core functionality)  
**High Priority:** 1 spec (needed for complete flows)  
**Medium Priority:** 2 specs (improves UX)  
**Low Priority:** 1 spec (polish)

## Analysis Documents Reference

Before starting implementation, review these analysis documents:

1. **ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary of gaps
2. **FEATURE_COMPARISON_TABLE.md** - Detailed feature comparison (75 features)
3. **ZENA_CHAT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md** - Complete technical analysis (2000+ lines)
4. **MOBILE_APP_IMPLEMENTATION_QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference guide
5. **MOBILE_APP_CRITICAL_CODE_EXAMPLES.md** - Ready-to-use code (1000+ lines)

## Implementation Specs Overview

### Phase 1: Critical Features (Week 1-2)

#### 1. File Upload System (3-4 days) - CRITICAL
**Spec:** `01-file-upload-system.md`

**Why Critical:** Property submission is impossible without video upload

**Deliverables:**
- Camera video recording

- Supabase Storage integration
- File preview and validation
- Upload progress tracking

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Users can record/select property videos
- ✅ Videos upload to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Public URLs returned and sent to AI

#### 2. Tool Result Rendering (4-5 days) - CRITICAL
**Spec:** `02-tool-result-rendering.md`

**Why Critical:** Users cannot interact with AI responses without proper UI

**Deliverables:**
- 15+ specialized tool result cards
- Tool result widget factory
- Property, payment, submission cards
- Interactive buttons and actions

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All 15+ tool types render correctly
- ✅ Interactive elements work
- ✅ 90%+ visual parity with web

#### 3. Multi-Turn Workflows (3-4 days) - CRITICAL
**Spec:** `03-multi-turn-workflows.md`

**Why Critical:** 5-stage property submission requires state tracking

**Deliverables:**
- Submission state manager
- Workflow stage tracking
- State persistence
- Stage progress UI

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ State persists across messages

- ✅ Multiple submissions tracked simultaneously

### Phase 2: High Priority (Week 3)

#### 4. Contact Info Request Flow (1-2 days) - HIGH

**Deliverables:**
- Phone confirmation card
- Phone input card
- Contact info display card
- Payment error card with retry

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Phone confirmation UI works
- ✅ Contact info displays after payment

**Note:** Backend handles all payment polling internally - mobile just displays results!

### Phase 3: Medium Priority (Week 4)

#### 5. Conversation Management (2-3 days) - MEDIUM
**Spec:** `05-conversation-management.md`

**Why Medium Priority:** Improves UX but not blocking

**Deliverables:**

- Conversation deletion

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Users can view all conversations
- ✅ Users can switch between conversations
- ✅ Conversations persist locally

#### 6. Message Persistence (2 days) - MEDIUM
**Spec:** `06-message-persistence.md`

**Why Medium Priority:** Improves reliability but not blocking

**Deliverables:**
- Message persistence service
- SQLite database setup
- Offline message queue
- Message sync service

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Messages persist after app restart
- ✅ Offline messages queue and send
- ✅ Tool results persist

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 5)

#### 7. UX Enhancements (2-3 days) - LOW
**Spec:** `07-ux-enhancements.md`

**Why Low Priority:** Nice to have, not blocking

**Deliverables:**
- Suggested queries
- Shimmer loading states
- Theme toggle
- Animations and transitions
- Accessibility improvements

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Suggested queries help new users
- ✅ Loading states are polished
- ✅ Theme toggle works

- **Developer 2:** Tool result cards (all 15+)
- **Developer 3:** Workflows, conversation management, persistence
- **All:** UX enhancements, testing

**Timeline:** 4 weeks

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Throughout)
- Test each service independently
- Test state management
- Test data parsing

### Widget Tests (Throughout)
- Test each UI component
- Test user interactions
- Test error states

### Integration Tests (Week 3-4)
- Test complete workflows
- Test end-to-end flows
- Test error handling

### Manual Tests (Week 4-5)
- Test on real Android devices
- Test on real iOS devices
- Test with real M-Pesa
- Test offline scenarios

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items:
1. **File Upload on iOS** - Camera permissions, file formats
   - Mitigation: Test early on real iOS device
   
2. **M-Pesa Payment Testing** - Need real M-Pesa for testing
   - Mitigation: Backend handles polling, mobile just displays results
   
3. **State Persistence** - Data loss, sync conflicts
   - Mitigation: Implement backup and recovery

### Medium Risk Items:
1. **Performance** - Large message lists, image loading
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, lazy loading
   
2. **Offline Support** - Message queue, sync conflicts
   - Mitigation: Test offline scenarios thoroughly
