# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Message Persistence Enhancement ensures that all messages (user, assistant, and tool results) are saved locally after streaming completes. This improves reliability by preventing data loss, enables offline access to message history, and provides a foundation for offline message queuing and sync capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Message Persistence After Streaming

**User Story:** As a user, I want my messages to be saved automatically, so that I don't lose my conversation history if the app closes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL save it to local storage immediately
2. WHEN an assistant message is streaming THEN the system SHALL save it after streaming completes
3. WHEN tool results are received THEN the system SHALL save them in the message metadata
4. WHEN a message is updated THEN the system SHALL update the stored version
5. WHEN the app restarts THEN the system SHALL load messages from local storage

### Requirement 2: Local Database Storage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want messages stored in a structured database, so that queries and retrieval are efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the app THEN the system SHALL create or open a SQLite database
2. WHEN storing messages THEN the system SHALL use a messages table with proper schema
3. WHEN storing tool results THEN the system SHALL serialize them as JSON in the database
4. WHEN querying messages THEN the system SHALL use indexed queries for performance
5. WHEN deleting a conversation THEN the system SHALL delete all associated messages

### Requirement 3: Offline Message Queue

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages even when offline, so that they're sent automatically when I reconnect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending a message while offline THEN the system SHALL add it to an offline queue
2. WHEN the device comes online THEN the system SHALL automatically send queued messages
3. WHEN queued messages are sent THEN the system SHALL update their status to synced
4. WHEN a queued message fails to send THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN viewing queued messages THEN the system SHALL display a "pending" indicator

### Requirement 4: Message Sync Service

**User Story:** As a user, I want my messages synced across devices, so that I can continue conversations on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL sync messages with the backend
2. WHEN new messages are received from backend THEN the system SHALL merge them with local messages
3. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL resolve using last-write-wins strategy
4. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL update the UI with any new messages
5. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry periodically in the background

### Requirement 5: Message Metadata Tracking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track message sync status and metadata, so that I can handle offline scenarios correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is created THEN the system SHALL add a synced flag (default: false)
2. WHEN a message is sent to backend THEN the system SHALL set synced flag to true
3. WHEN a message is created offline THEN the system SHALL set localOnly flag to true
4. WHEN a message is updated THEN the system SHALL update the updatedAt timestamp
5. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL show sync status indicators for unsynced messages

### Requirement 6: Data Cleanup and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want old messages cleaned up automatically, so that the app doesn't consume excessive storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages exceed a threshold (e.g., 1000 per conversation) THEN the system SHALL archive old messages
2. WHEN a conversation is deleted THEN the system SHALL delete all associated messages
3. WHEN clearing app data THEN the system SHALL provide an option to clear message history
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow exporting conversation history
5. WHEN storage is low THEN the system SHALL notify the user and offer cleanup options
