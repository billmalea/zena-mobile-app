   - Spec 03: Multi-Turn Workflows (CRITICAL)
   - Spec 04: Contact Info Request Flow (HIGH)
   - Spec 05: Conversation Management (MEDIUM)
   - Spec 06: Message Persistence (MEDIUM)
   - Spec 07: UX Enhancements (LOW)

3. **Create Task Documents** - 1-2 hours

## Alignment with Roadmap

✅ **All specs align with roadmap** - No conflicts detected

**Roadmap Phases:**
- Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Specs 01, 02, 03 - CRITICAL
- Phase 2 (Week 3): Spec 04 - HIGH
- Phase 3 (Week 4): Specs 05, 06 - MEDIUM
- Phase 4 (Week 5): Spec 07 - LOW

**Spec Priority:**
- CRITICAL: 01, 02, 03 (blocking core functionality)
- HIGH: 04 (needed for complete flows)
- MEDIUM: 05, 06 (improves UX)
- LOW: 07 (polish)

---

## Key Insights

1. **File Upload is 95% done** - Just needs a 5-minute fix to work with backend
2. **Payment polling simplified** - Backend handles it, mobile just displays UI (50% effort reduction)
3. **Tool Result Rendering is the next blocker** - Need 15+ specialized cards
4. **Multi-Turn Workflows is critical** - Required for 5-stage property submission
5. **Conversation Management has foundation** - Service and model exist, just need UI
6. **Message Persistence is standalone** - Can be implemented independently
7. **UX Enhancements are polish** - Should be done last

---

## Estimated Completion Timeline

**With Current Progress:**
- Spec 01: 1 hour (fix + testing)
- Spec 02: 4-5 days (15+ cards)
- Spec 03: 3-4 days (state management)
- Spec 04: 1-2 days (4 UI cards)
- Spec 05: 2-3 days (conversation UI)
- Spec 06: 2 days (persistence)
