## Why This Approach?

### Automated Testing (What We Can Test)

âœ… **Logic and Algorithms**
- File size calculations
- Format detection
- Filename generation
- Progress calculations
- Error message formatting

These don't require:
- Physical devices
- Camera hardware
- Network connections
- Supabase initialization

### Manual Testing (What Requires Devices)

ðŸ“‹ **Hardware and Platform Features**
- Camera access
- Gallery/photo library access
- Permission dialogs
- Network operations
- UI interactions
- Platform-specific behavior

These require:
- Physical Android/iOS devices
- Real camera hardware
- Actual Supabase uploads
- User interaction

---

### Automated Coverage: ~40%

**What's Tested:**
- âœ… All validation logic
- âœ… All calculation logic
- âœ… All formatting logic
- âœ… Error message generation
- âœ… File URL formatting

**Benefits:**
- Fast execution (~4 seconds)
- Repeatable
- No device required
- Catches logic errors early

### Manual Coverage: ~60%

**What Needs Testing:**
- ðŸ“‹ Camera integration
- ðŸ“‹ Gallery integration
- ðŸ“‹ Supabase uploads

## How to Complete Manual Testing

### Quick Start

1. **Run automated tests** (verify they pass):
   ```bash
   flutter test test/file_upload_validation_test.dart
   ```

2. **Deploy to Android device**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d android
   ```

3. **Open the manual testing checklist**:
   - `.kiro/specs/01-file-upload-system/MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`

4. **Test Priority 1 items** (critical functionality):
   - Camera recording
   - Gallery selection
   - File upload
   - Message sending
   - AI processing

5. **Deploy to iOS device**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

6. **Repeat Priority 1 tests** on iOS

7. **Document results** in the checklist

8. **Sign off** when all critical tests pass
