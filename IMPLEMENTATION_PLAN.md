# ZENA Mobile App - Complete Implementation Plan

## üéØ Overview

This document provides a complete implementation plan to achieve feature parity between the Zena web and mobile applications. After deep analysis of both codebases, we've identified that **70% of web features are missing** in the mobile app.

## üìä Current State

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Basic chat messaging
- Streaming AI responses
- User authentication
- Basic property card display
- Conversation creation/loading

### What's Missing ‚ùå
- **File upload system** (CRITICAL - blocking property submission)
- **14+ specialized tool result cards** (CRITICAL - users can't interact with AI)
- **Multi-turn workflow state** (CRITICAL - 5-stage submission won't work)
- **Payment status polling** (HIGH - contact requests incomplete)
- **Conversation management UI** (MEDIUM - improves UX)
- **Message persistence** (MEDIUM - messages lost on restart)
- **UX polish** (LOW - suggested queries, themes, animations)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Understand the Gaps
Read these in order:
1. `MISSING MD/ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md` - Get the big picture
2. `MISSING MD/FEATURE_COMPARISON_TABLE.md` - See what's missing
3. `.kiro/specs/00-implementation-roadmap.md` - Understand the plan

### Step 2: Review Code Examples
- `MISSING MD/MOBILE_APP_CRITICAL_CODE_EXAMPLES.md` has 1000+ lines of ready-to-use code
- Copy and adapt code as needed
- Follow patterns from web implementation

### Step 3: Start Implementation
Begin with **Spec 01: File Upload System** - this is CRITICAL and blocks everything else

### Step 4: Follow the Roadmap
Implement specs in order:
- **Week 1-2:** Critical features (file upload, tool cards, workflows)
- **Week 3:** High priority (payment polling)
- **Week 4:** Medium priority (conversations, persistence)
- **Week 5:** Polish (UX enhancements)

## üìã Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: CRITICAL (Must Have) - Week 1-2
These features are **blocking** - core functionality won't work without them:

1. **File Upload System** (3-4 days)
   - Camera video recording
   - Gallery selection
   - Supabase Storage upload
   - **Why:** Property submission impossible without it

2. **Tool Result Rendering** (4-5 days)
   - 15+ specialized UI cards
   - Interactive buttons
   - **Why:** Users can't interact with AI responses

3. **Multi-Turn Workflows** (3-4 days)
   - Submission state tracking
   - 5-stage workflow support
   - **Why:** Property submission requires state persistence

### Phase 2: HIGH (Should Have) - Week 3
These features are **needed** for complete user flows:

4. **Payment Status Polling** (2-3 days)
   - Real-time M-Pesa status updates
   - Retry on failure
   - **Why:** Contact requests incomplete without confirmation

### Phase 3: MEDIUM (Nice to Have) - Week 4
These features **improve UX** but aren't blocking:

5. **Conversation Management** (2-3 days)
   - Conversation list UI
   - Switching between conversations
   - **Why:** Better navigation and organization

6. **Message Persistence** (2 days)
   - Save messages locally
   - Offline support
   - **Why:** Messages lost on app restart

### Phase 4: LOW (Polish) - Week 5
These features **enhance experience** but aren't essential:

7. **UX Enhancements** (2-3 days)
   - Suggested queries
   - Shimmer loading
   - Theme toggle
   - **Why:** Professional polish and accessibility

## üìà Timeline & Effort

### With 2 Developers: 5 weeks
- Developer 1: File upload, payment polling, persistence
- Developer 2: Tool cards, workflows, conversations
- Both: UX enhancements, testing

### With 3 Developers: 4 weeks
- Developer 1: File upload, payment polling
- Developer 2: All tool result cards
- Developer 3: Workflows, conversations, persistence
- All: UX enhancements, testing

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### Must Achieve (Phase 1-2):
- ‚úÖ Users can upload property videos
- ‚úÖ Users can complete 5-stage property submission
- ‚úÖ Users can request contact info and pay via M-Pesa
- ‚úÖ Users can see all tool results with proper UI
- ‚úÖ Payment status updates in real-time

### Should Achieve (Phase 3):
- ‚úÖ Users can manage multiple conversations
- ‚úÖ Messages persist after app restart
- ‚úÖ Offline messages queue and send

### Nice to Achieve (Phase 4):
- ‚úÖ Suggested queries help new users
- ‚úÖ Loading states are polished
- ‚úÖ Theme toggle works
- ‚úÖ App is accessible

## üîß Technical Stack

### Already Installed:
- ‚úÖ Flutter SDK
- ‚úÖ Provider (state management)
- ‚úÖ Supabase Flutter
- ‚úÖ image_picker
- ‚úÖ http, uuid, intl

### May Need to Add:
- sqflite (for message persistence)
- shimmer (for loading states)
- lottie (for animations - optional)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Throughout)
- Test services independently
- Test state management
- Test data parsing

### Widget Tests (Throughout)
- Test UI components
- Test user interactions
- Test error states

### Integration Tests (Week 3-4)
- Test complete workflows
- Test end-to-end flows
- Test error handling

### Manual Tests (Week 4-5)
- Test on real Android devices
- Test on real iOS devices
- Test with real M-Pesa
- Test offline scenarios

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

### DO NOT SKIP FILE UPLOAD
Everything depends on it. Property submission is the core feature and requires video upload.

### TEST ON REAL DEVICES
- Camera and gallery don't work in emulators
- M-Pesa requires real phone
- File upload needs real device testing

### FOLLOW WEB PATTERNS
The web app has proven UI/UX patterns. Reuse them for consistency.

### TEST INCREMENTALLY
Don't wait until the end to test. Test each feature as you build it.
