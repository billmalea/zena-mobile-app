# Verify Fix is Working

## What Should Happen

When you send "Hello", you should see:

### In the Logs
```
✅ [ChatProvider] Tool result added, message updated
📝 [ChatProvider] Message content: "I found some results for you:"
🔧 [ChatProvider] Tool results count: 1
🔔 [ChatProvider] Calling notifyListeners()
✅ [ChatProvider] notifyListeners() called
```

### In the UI
1. Your message: "Hello"
2. AI message: "I found some results for you:"
3. Property results card (if any properties found)

## If You're Still Not Seeing Anything

### Check 1: Is the Message There?

Look at the chat screen. Do you see:
- ✅ Your "Hello" message?
- ❌ Empty space where AI response should be?
- ❌ Loading indicator stuck?

### Check 2: Check the Logs

Look for these specific logs:
```
📝 [ChatProvider] Message content: "I found some results for you:"
🔧 [ChatProvider] Tool results count: 1
```

If you see these, the message IS being updated, but the UI might not be rendering it.

### Check 3: Scroll Down

Sometimes the message is there but you need to scroll down to see it.

### Check 4: Check Message Bubble

The message bubble should show:
1. The text content ("I found some results for you:")
2. The tool results (property cards)

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Hot Restart
```bash
# Press 'R' in terminal
# Or restart the app completely
```

### Step 2: Send Message
```
Type: "Hello"
Press: Send
```

### Step 3: Check Logs
Look for:
- ✅ Message content logged
- ✅ Tool results count logged
- ✅ notifyListeners() called

### Step 4: Check UI
Look for:
- ✅ Your message visible
- ✅ AI message visible
- ✅ Tool results visible

## If Message Content is Empty

If you see:
```
📝 [ChatProvider] Message content: ""
```

This means the default text isn't being added. Check:
1. Is `content.isEmpty` true?
2. Are `updatedToolResults.isNotEmpty` true?

## If Tool Results Count is 0

If you see:
```
🔧 [ChatProvider] Tool results count: 0
```

This means tool results aren't being added. Check:
1. Are tool result events being received?
2. Is the tool result parsing working?

## If notifyListeners() Not Called

If you don't see:
```
✅ [ChatProvider] notifyListeners() called
```

This means the code isn't reaching that point. Check for errors above.

## Expected Complete Flow
