### 6. Updated Chat Screen (`lib/screens/chat/chat_screen.dart`)
✅ **Updated** - Integrated file upload UI

**Changes:**
- Updated imports to include `dart:io`

```

## User Flow

1. **User taps attach button** in message input
2. **Bottom sheet appears** with camera/gallery options
3. **User selects video source** (camera or gallery)
4. **File preview shows** selected video with size
5. **User can add more files** or remove files
6. **User taps upload button**
7. **Files upload to Supabase Storage** with progress indication
8. **Public URLs are generated** and sent to chat API
9. **AI receives and processes** the video URLs
10. **User sees response** from AI about the property

## Technical Details

### Supabase Storage Integration
- **Bucket:** `property-media`
- **Path Structure:** `{userId}/{timestamp}.{extension}`
- **Access:** Public URLs for uploaded files
- **File Options:**
  - Content-Type: Automatically detected from extension
  - Cache-Control: 3600 seconds
  - Upsert: false (prevent overwrites)

### File Validation
- **Max File Size:** 10MB (configurable)
- **Max Video Duration:** 2 minutes (configurable)
- **Supported Formats:** mp4, mov, avi, webm
- **Validation Points:**
  - Before adding to selection
  - User feedback via snackbar

### Error Handling
- **Upload Failures:** Custom `FileUploadException` with original error
- **Network Errors:** Caught and displayed to user
- **Authentication Errors:** Checked before upload
- **File Access Errors:** Handled gracefully

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Compilation
- [x] All files compile without errors
- [x] No diagnostic issues
- [x] Dependencies installed successfully

### ⏳ Manual Testing Required (Real Device)
- [ ] Camera recording works on Android
- [ ] Camera recording works on iOS
- [ ] Gallery selection works on Android

### Prerequisites for Testing
1. **Supabase Storage:**
   - Bucket `property-media` must exist

   - Storage policies must allow public reads

2. **Permissions:**
   - Camera permission configured in AndroidManifest.xml
   - Camera permission configured in Info.plist (iOS)
   - Storage permission configured (if needed)

   - Test camera recording
   - Test gallery selection
   - Test file upload to Supabase

2. **Verify Supabase Setup:**
   - Check if `property-media` bucket exists
   - Verify storage policies allow uploads
   - Test public URL access

3. **Test End-to-End Flow:**
   - Upload property video
   - Verify AI receives video URL
   - Check AI response about property

4. **Move to Next Spec:**
   - Once testing is complete, move to Spec 02: Tool Result Rendering

## Known Limitations

1. **Camera/Gallery Testing:**
   - Cannot test camera in emulator
   - Requires real device for full testing

2. **Supabase Storage:**
   - Requires bucket to be created manually
   - Requires storage policies to be configured

3. **File Size:**
   - 10MB limit may be restrictive for high-quality videos
   - Can be increased if needed

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Supabase Storage Bucket
```sql
-- Create bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('property-media', 'property-media', true);

-- Allow authenticated uploads
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'property-media');

-- Allow public reads
CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'property-media');
```

## Conclusion

The file upload system is **fully implemented and ready for device testing**. All code compiles without errors, and the implementation follows best practices for Flutter development. The system is well-structured, maintainable, and provides excellent user experience.

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Ready for Device Testing
