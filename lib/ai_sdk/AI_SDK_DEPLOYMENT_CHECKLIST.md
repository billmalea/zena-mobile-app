flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build for Android
flutter build apk --release

```bash
# Merge to staging branch
git checkout staging
git merge backup-before-ai-sdk-client
git push origin staging
```
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Staging tests pass
- [ ] No regressions found

### Step 7: Monitor Staging
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify user feedback

### Step 8: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge staging
git tag -a v1.0.0-ai-sdk -m "AI SDK Dart client implementation"
git push origin main --tags
```
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Version tagged
- [ ] Release notes published

### Step 9: Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor error rates

- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Monitor user feedback

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur

#### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git checkout main
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

#### Full Rollback
```bash
# Restore from backup
git checkout main
git reset --hard backup-before-ai-sdk-client
git push origin main --force
```

### Rollback Triggers
